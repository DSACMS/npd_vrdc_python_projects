Auto-generated IDROutputter implementation for IDRC_PRD.CMS_VDM_VIEW_MDCR_PRD.V2_PRVDR_ENRLMT_MDCR_ID_DEACTVTN_RSN_CRNT

This script provides a complete IDROutputter subclass that exports all columns
from the table in their original Snowflake order. You can customize the
getSelectQuery() method to add WHERE clauses, JOINs, or modify column selection.

Usage:
    # In a Snowflake notebook environment:
    exporter = V2PrvdrEnrlmtMdcrIdDeactvtnRsnCrntExporter()
    exporter.do_idr_output()
