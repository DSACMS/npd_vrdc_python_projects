Auto-generated IDROutputter implementation for IDRC_PRD.CMS_VDM_VIEW_MDCR_PRD.V2_PRVDR_ENMRT_SCNDRY_LANG_HSTRY

This script provides a complete IDROutputter subclass that exports all columns
from the table in their original Snowflake order. You can customize the
getSelectQuery() method to add WHERE clauses, JOINs, or modify column selection.

Usage:
    # In a Snowflake notebook environment:
    exporter = V2PrvdrEnmrtScndryLangHstryExporter()
    exporter.do_idr_output()
